This is an example webapp for the udata hub.

Basically this example is using the udata hub API to store some todo items.

This exaple needs to be delivered by the udata hub instance, typically this
can happen by putting this code within th public/ path of the udata hub
repository. Actually this example is a submodule in the udata hub sources.

Take a look there.
